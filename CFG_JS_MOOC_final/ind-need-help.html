                    Tips to save money on your grocery shopping
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Get low priced ingredients by going to the discount section of a supermarket in the early morning or 
                            after 6pm and look for the yellow discount stickers. <b>Top tip:</b> Many stores, for example, Tesco, 
                            will have a dedicated shelf or freezer area for discounted items, so find out where that is in your 
                            local shop to save you time and money.</li>
                            <p></p>
                        <li>If shopping for groceries online, look out for flash sales at Morrisons and Ocado. <b>Top tip:</b> You will 
                            find the flash sales just before you checkout highlighted in red font. </li>
                            <p></p>
                        <li>Try supermarket own brand products. Some are so good that it is hard to tell the difference from branded products. 
                            <b>Top tip:</b> replace Heinz baked beans with own brand, we like Morrisons Baked Beans.  </li>
                            <p></p>
                        <li>If certain branded products are difficult to replace like Heinz Tomato Ketchup, wait for the sales, buy in 
                            bulk and in bigger sizes if the product has a long shelf life or you/your family/flatmates will get through 
                            it before expiry. <b>Top tip:</b> we’re loving Gold Star Tomato Ketchup 690g for £1 from Iceland. </li>
                            <p></p>
                        <li>To compare the price of items you regularly buy and family favourites across various supermarkets, 
                            check <a href="https://www.trolley.co.uk"> Trolley</a>&ensp; to see which shop will give you the best value. </li>

                        <li>Sign up to supermarket newsletters and receive offers / promos by email, post and text. Some supermarkets will 
                            send money off vouchers to your door like Lidl, so sign up to get the marketing mail, ask instore. Many supermarkets 
                            will send you voucher codes direct to your email. If you are a new customer, sign up for a welcome bonus on your first 
                            shop and some run for the first couple of shops. Iceland will send you voucher codes by text and email.

                        <li>A slow cooker is about £15-20 to purchase. Think of it as an investment to make cooking easier and 
                            cheaper. <b>Top tip:</b> You can get the 1.8l slow cooker for £15 from <a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/9306561">Argos</a>&ensp;

                            in the week. You can make healthy nutritious meals using a slow cooker. </li>
